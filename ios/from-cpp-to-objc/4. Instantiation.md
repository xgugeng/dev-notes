# 4.1 Instantiation

In Objective-C, all objects are dynamically allocated.
In C++ , allocation and initialization of an object are mixed when calling the constructor. In Objective-C, they are two different methods.
Allocation is handled by the class method alloc , which also initializes all instance data. The initialization step is not optional, and alloc  should always be followed by init;

C++  requires either exception catching, or a test against 0 (if new(nothrow)  was used). With Objective-C, a test against nil  is sufficient.


The constraints for a correct initializer are

- its name begins with init ;
- it returns the object to use;
- it calls some init  method of the superclass, so that init  of NSObject  will finally be called;
- it takes in account the value returned by [super init...] ;
- it handles correctly the construction errors, whether they are voluntary or inherited.

The notion of default constructor has no real meaning in Objective-C. Because all objects are allocated dynamically, their construction is always explicit.

The idea of list of initialization  for C++  constructors does not exist in Objective-C. However, it is remarkable that, unlike the C++  behaviour, the alloc  method of Objective-C initializes all the bits of instance data to 0, so the pointers are set to nil .

# 4.2 Destructors

In C++ , the destructor, like the constructor, is a specific method that can be redefined. In Objective-C, it is an instance method named dealloc .
In C++ , the destructor is called automatically when an object is freed; it is the same with Objective-C; only the way to release the object is different. The destructor should never be called explicitly.

# 4.3 Copy operators

In C++ , it is important to define a coherent implementation of the copy constructor and the affectation operator. In Objective-C, operator overloading is impossible; one must only ensure that the cloning method is correct.

Cloning in Cocoa is associated with a protocol named NSCopying , requesting the implementation of the method
-(id) copyWithZone:(NSZone*)zone;
Its argument is a memory zone in which the clone should be allocated. Cocoa allows the use of different custom zones: some methods take such a zone as an argument. Most of the times, the default zone is perfect, and there is no need to specify it each time. Fortunately, NSObject  supplies a method
-(id) copy;
which encapsulates a call to copyWithZone:  with the default zone as parameter.
