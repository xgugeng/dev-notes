# 5.1 new and delete

The C++  keywords new  and delete do not exist in Objective-C (new  exists as a method, but it is just a deprecated shortcut for alloc +init ). They are respectively replaced by calls to alloc and release.

# 5.3 Reference counting

Objective-C implements a reference counting scheme.
An object can receive as many retain  and release  messages as needed, as long as the reference counter has a positive value. As soon as it falls to 0, the destructor dealloc  is automatically called. Sending release  again to the address of the object, which is now invalid, triggers a memory fault.

# 5.4 autorelease

Everything that increases the reference counter with alloc , [mutable]copy[WithZone:]  or retain  is in charge of the corresponding [auto]release.

# 5.5 Garbage collector

Objective-C 2.0 implements a garbage collector. In other words, you can delegate all the memory management and do not care about retain  and release  any more.
