# 9.1 Reading Command-Line Options

When Python starts, command-line options are placed in the list `sys.argv`.The first element is the name of the program.

```python
import sys
if len(sys.argv) != 3:
    sys.stderr.write("Usage : python %s inputfile outputfile\n" % sys.argv[0])
    raise SystemExit(1)
inputfile = sys.argv[1]
outputfile = sys.argv[2]
```

Raising `SystemExit` with a non-zero exit code is standard practice for reporting usage errors in command-line tools.

Use theUoptparse module for more complicated command-line handling.

```python
import optparse
p = optparse.OptionParser()
# An option taking an argument
p.add_option("-o",action="store",dest="outfile")
p.add_option("--output",action="store",dest="outfile")
# An option that sets a boolean flag
p.add_option("-d",action="store_true",dest="debug")
p.add_option("--debug",action="store_true",dest="debug")
# Set default values for selected options
p.set_defaults(debug=False)
# Parse the command line
opts, args = p.parse_args()
# Retrieve the option settings
outfile = opts.outfile
debugmode = opts.debug
```

Parsing is performed using the `p.parse_args()` method.This method returns a 2-tuple `(opts, args)` where `opts` is an object containing the parsed option values and `args` is a list of items on the command line not parsed as options.


# 9.2 Environment Variables

Environment variables are accessed in the dictionary `os.environ`.

```python
import os
path = os.environ["PATH"]
user = os.environ["USER"]
editor = os.environ["EDITOR"]
```

To modify the environment variables, set the `os.environ` variable, `os.environ["FOO"] = "BAR"`.

Modifications to `os.environ` affect both the running program and subprocesses created by Python.


# 9.3 Files and File Objects

The built-in function `open(name, [, mode, [, bufsize]])` opens and creates a file object,

```python
f = open("foo") # Opens "foo" for reading
f = open("foo",'r') # Opens "foo" for reading (same as above)
f = open("foo",'w') # Open for writing
```

The file mode is 'r' for read, 'w' for write, or 'a' for append.These file modes assume text-mode and may implicitly perform translation of the newline character '\n'.

If you are working with binary data, append a 'b' to the file mode such as 'rb' or 'wb'.This disables newline translation and should be included if you are concerned about portability of code that processes binary data.

A file can be opened for in-place updates by supplying a plus (+) character, such as 'r+' or 'w+'.

If a file is opened with mode 'U' or 'rU', it provides universal newline support for reading.

The optional `bufsize` parameter controls the buffering behavior of the file, where 0 is unbuffered, 1 is line buffered, and a negative number requests the system default.Any other positive number indicates the approximate buffer size in bytes that will be used.

File Methods

| Method | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| f.read([n]) | Reads at most n bytes. |
| f.readline([n]) | Reads a single line of input up to n characters. If n is omitted, this method reads the entire line. |
| f.readlines([size]) | Reads all the lines and returns a list. size optionally specifies the approximate number of characters to read on the file before stopping. |
| f.write(s) | Writes string s. |
| f.writelines(lines) | Writes all strings in sequence lines. |
| f.close() | Closes the file. |
| f.tell() | Returns the current file pointer. |
| f.seek(offset [, whence]) | Seeks to a new file position. |
| f.isatty() | Returns 1 if f is an interactive terminal. |
| f.flush() | Flushes the output buffers. |
| f.truncate([size]) | Truncates the file to at most size bytes. |
| f.fileno() | Returns an integer file descriptor. |
| f.next() | Returns the next line or raises StopIteration. In Python 3, it is called `f.__next__()`. |

The `read()` method returns the entire file as a string unless an optional length parameter is given specifying the maximum number of characters. The `readline()` method returns the next line of input, including the terminating newline.

Both the `readline()` and `readlines()` methods are platform-aware and handle different representations of newlines properly.

`read()` and `readline()` indicate end-of-file (EOF) by returning an empty string.

```python
while True:
    line = f.readline()
    if not line: # EOF
        break
```

A convenient way to read all lines in a file is to use iteration with a `for` loop,

```python
for line in f: # Iterate over all lines in the file
    # Do sth
```

In Python 2, the various read operations always return 8-bit strings, regardless of the file mode that was specified (text or binary). In Python 3, these operations return Unicode strings if a file has been opened in text mode and byte strings if the file is opened in binary mode.

`write()` and `writelines()` do not add newline characters to the output, so all output that you produce should already include all necessary formatting.

File objects also have the read-only data attributes.

| Attribute | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| f.closed | Boolean value indicates the file state |
| f.mode | The I/O mode for the file |
| f.name | Name of the file if created using open(). Otherwise, it will be a string indicating the source of the file. |
| f.softspace | Boolean value indicating whether a space character needs to be printed before another value when using the print statement. |
| f.newlines | When a file is opened in universal newline mode, this attribute contains the newline representation actually found in the file. |
| f.encoding | A string that indicates file encoding |


# 9.4 Standard Input, Output, and Error

The interpreter provides three standard file objects, known as standard input, standard output, and standard error, which are available in the sys module as `sys.stdin`, `sys.stdout`, and `sys.stderr`.

`stdin` is a file object corresponding to the stream of input characters supplied to the interpreter. `stdout` is the file object that receives output produced by print. `stderr` is a file that receives error messages. More often than not, `stdin` is mapped to the user’s keyboard, whereas `stdout` and `stderr` produce text onscreen.

The following code writes to standard output and reads a line of input from standard input:

```python
import sys
sys.stdout.write("Enter your name : ")
name = sys.stdin.readline()
```

Alternatively, the built-in function `raw_input(prompt)` can read a line of text from `stdin` and optionally print a prompt:

```python
name = raw_input("Enter your name : ")
```

Lines read by `raw_input()` do not include the trailing newline.This is different than reading directly from `sys.stdin` where newlines are included in the input text.

Keyboard interrupts (typically generated by Ctrl+C) result in a `KeyboardInterrupt` exception that can be caught using an exception handler.


# 9.5 The `print` Statement

Python 2 uses a special print statement to produce output on the file contained in `sys.stdout`. 

```python
print "The values are", x, y, z
```

For each object, the `str()` function is invoked to produce an output string. These output strings are then joined and separated by **a single space** to produce the final output string.The output is terminated by a newline unless a trailing comma is supplied to the `print` statement. In this case, the next print statement will insert a space before printing more items.

```python
print "The values are ", x, y, z, w
# Print the same text, using two print statements
print "The values are ", x, y, # Omits trailing newline
print z, w # A space is printed before z
```

To produce formatted output, use the string-formatting operator (`%`) or the `.format()` method.

```python
print "The values are %d %7.5f %s" % (x,y,z) # Formatted I/O
print "The values are {0:d} {1:7.5f} {2}".format(x,y,z)
```

You can change the destination of the `print` statement by adding the special `>>file` modifier followed by a comma.

```python
f = open("output","w")
print >>f, "hello world"
f.close()
```


# 9.6 The `print()` Function

`print` is turned into a function in Python 3. To print a series of values separated by spaces, just supply them all to `print()` like this:

```python
print("The values are", x, y, z) 
```


# 9.7 Variable Interpolation in Text Output

Many scripting languages such as Perl and PHP allow variables to be inserted into strings using dollar-variable substitutions (that is, `$name`, `$address`, and so on). Python provides no direct equivalent of this feature, but it can be emulated using formatted I/O combined with triple-quoted strings.

```python
form = """\
Dear {name},
Please send back my {item} or pay me {amount:0.2f}.
Sincerely yours,
Joe Python User
"""
print form.format(name='Mr. Bush', item='blender', amount=50.0)
```

For certain kinds of forms, you can also use `Template` strings, as follows:

```python
import string
form = string.Template("""\
Dear $name,
Please send back my $item or pay me $amount.
                                    Sincerely yours,
                                    Joe Python User
""")
print form.substitute({'name': 'Mr. Bush',
                        'item': 'blender',
                        'amount': "%0.2f" % 50.0})
```


# 9.8 Generating Output

Generator functions can also be used to emit an I/O stream as a sequence of data fragments. To do this, simply use the `yield` statement like you would use a `write()` or `print` statement.

```python
def countdown(n):
    while n > 0:
        yield "T-minus %d\n" % n
        n -= 1
    yield "Kaboom!\n"
```

If you wanted to route the above output to a file `f`, you could do this:

```python
count = countdown(5)
f.writelines(count)
```


# 9.9 Unicode String Handling

If you have a string s of raw bytes containing an encoded representation of a Unicode string, use the `s.decode([encoding [,errors]])` method to convert it into a proper Unicode string.To convert a Unicode
string, `u`, to an encoded byte string, use the string method `u.encode([encoding [, errors]])`.

The default encoding is set in the `site` module and can be queried using `sys.getdefaultencoding()`. In many cases, the default encoding is 'ascii'.


# 9.10 Unicode I/O

When working with Unicode strings, **it is never possible to directly write raw Unicode data to a file**. This is due to the fact that Unicode characters are internally represented as multibyte integers and that writing such integers directly to an output stream causes problems related to byte ordering.

The built-in `codecs` module contains a collection of functions for converting byte-oriented data to and from Unicode strings according to a variety of different data-encoding schemes.

```python
f = codecs.open('foo.txt','r','utf-8','strict') # Reading
g = codecs.open('bar.txt','w','utf-8') # Writing
```

If you already have a file object, the `codecs.EncodedFile(file, inputenc [, outputenc [, errors]])` function can be used to place an encoding wrapper around it.

```python
f = open("foo.txt","rb")
fenc = codecs.EncodedFile(f,'utf-8')
```

When the encoding is read from a document, code similar to the following can be used to turn the input file into an encoded stream:

```python
f = open("somefile","rb")
# Determine encoding of the file
...
# Put an appropriate encoding wrapper on the file.
# Assumes that the BOM (if any) has already been discarded
# by earlier statements.
fenc = codecs.EncodedFile(f,encoding)
data = fenc.read()
```


# 9.11 Unicode Character Properties

The `unicodedata` module provides access to a database of character properties. General character properties can be obtained with the `unicodedata.category(c)` function. `unicodedata.category(u"A")` returns 'Lu', signifying that the character is an uppercase letter.

Another tricky problem with Unicode strings is that there might be multiple representations of the same Unicode string.


# 9.12 Object Persistence and the `pickle` Module

The `pickle` module serializes an object into a stream of bytes that can be written to a file and later restored.

```python
import pickle
obj = SomeObject()
f = open(filename,'wb')
pickle.dump(obj, f) # Save object on f
f.close()
```

To restore the object, you can use the following code:

```python
import pickle
f = open(filename,'rb')
obj = pickle.load(f) # Restore the object
f.close()
```

The `shelve` module is similar to pickle but saves objects in a dictionary-like database:

```python
import shelve
obj = SomeObject()
db = shelve.open("filename") # Open a shelve
db['key'] = obj # Save object in the shelve
...
obj = db['key'] # Retrieve it
db.close()
```

Similarly, a `shelve` can be opened to save Python objects using an alternative `pickle` protocol like this:

```python
import shelve
db = shelve.open(filename,protocol=2)
```
