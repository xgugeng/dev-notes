# 7.1 Key-value coding

The Key-value coding  is the name given to the practice of accessing the value of a data member by its name. This is kind of similar to the an associative array (NSDictionary).

The class NSObject  provides methods entitled valueForKey:  and setValue:forKey: .

# 7.2 Property

The keyword @property  (and some attributes) can be associated to a data member, to tell how the accessors can be automatically generated by the compiler. It aims at writing less code and save some development time.
