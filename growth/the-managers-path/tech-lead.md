Tech lead is not the job for the person who wants the freedom to focus deeply on the details of her own code. A tech lead who does this is not doing her job.

What is a tech lead?

1. This role may not include people management, but is still expected to provide mentorship and guidance to the other teammates.
2. Learning how to be a strong technical project manager. They focus on the whole team's productivity and strive to increase the impact of the team's product.

Tech leads will be working on one major new tech skill: project management. The work of **breaking down a project** has a lot of similarity to the work of designing systems.

## One Weird Trick

A tech lead must figure out one biggest trick of being a tech lead: the willingness to **step back from the code and figure out how to balance your technical commitments with the work the whole team needs**.

Through trial and error, you'll learn how to manage your time to provide yourself with appropriately sized blocks to work in.

## The Main Roles of a Tech Lead

Your highest priority as a tech lead is taking a wide view of the work so that you keep the project moving.

1. Systems architect and business analyst. In these roles, you identify the critical features that need to be built to deliver upcoming projects. The role requires you to
    - have a good sense of the overall architecture of your systems and a solid understanding of how to design complex software
    - be able to understand business requirements and translate them into software
2. Project planner. With this hat on, you're going to find efficient ways of breaking down the work.
3. Software developer and team leader.
    - write code (not too much),
    - communicate challenges,
    - and delegate.

## Managing Projects

Project management is the art of breaking a complex end goal down into a smaller pieces, putting those pieces in roughly the most effective order they should be done, identifying which pieces can be done in parallel and which must be done in sequence, and attempting to tease out the unknowns of the project that may cause it to slow down or fail completely.

1. Break down the work
2. Push through the details and the unknowns
3. Run the project and adjust the plan as you go. As things flip, keep everyone apprised of the status
4. Use the insights gained in the planning process to manage requirements changes.
5. Revisit the details as you get close to completion.

## How to Be a Great Tech Lead

### Understand the Architecture

You must fully understand the arch you are supporting,

1. where the data lives, how if flows between systems
2. how it reflects the products
3. where the core logic for those products

### Be a Team Player

If you are doing all the interesting work yourself, stop. Look at the tricky, boring, or annoying areas of technical need.

If you are only doing the most boring work, stop that, too.

### Lead Technical Decisions

Determine which decisions must be made by you, and which can be deleted to others with more expertise, and which requires the whole team to resolve.

### Communicate

Practice your writing and speaking skills.

Don't forget to listen, give others a chance to speak, and hear what they say. *Rephrase that someone says* in your word.
