## What to Expect from a Manager

Managers who

1. care about you as a person
2. actively work to help you grow in your career
3. teach you important skills and give you valuable feedback
4. help you understand what is important to focus on, and enable you to have that focus

### One-on-One Meetings

One-on-one meetings (1-1s) with your direct manager are an essential feature of a good working relationship.

1-1s serve 2 purposes,

1. they create human connection between you and your manager. The bedrock of strong teams is human connection, which leads to trust.
2. A regular opportunity for you to speak privately with your manager about what ever needs discussing. *It's good for you to put a little thought into what you might actually want to discuss before your 1-1s.*

If your 1-1 is a dreadful obligation for delivering a boring status report, try using email or chat for that purpose instead for free up the time, and bringing some topics to your own to the 1-1.

### Feedback and Workplace Guidance

The only thing worse than a getting a behavioral feedback is not getting it at all, or getting only during your performance review.

Good managers know that delivering feedback quickly is more valuable than waiting for a convenient time to say something.

When it comes to your role at the company, your manager needs to be your number on ally. *Sitting down with your manager and asking her what areas you need to focus on to get promoted.* If you don't ask your manager about a promotion, don't expect her to just give you one magically.

Your manager should be the person who shows you the larger picture of how your work fits into the team's goals, and helps you feel a sense of purpose in the day-to-day work.

### Training and Career Growth

Your manager may hold sme responsibility for helping you find training and other resources for career growth. But *expect that you are responsible, for the most part.*

When you are interested in being promoted, it's very important to ask your manager for specific areas to focus on in order to get that promotion.

## How to Be Managed

**Developing a sense of ownership and authority for your own experiences at work, and not relying on your manager to set the entire tone for your relationship**, is and important step in owning your career and workplace happiness.

### Spend Time Thinking About What You Want

Your manager cannot tell you what make you happy. 

Use your manager to discover what's possible where you are, but look to understand yourself in order to figure out where you want to go next.

### You Are Responsible for Yourself

Knowing yourself is step one, the next step is going after what you want.

You will not get everything you ask for, and asking is not usually a fun or comfortable experience. However it's the fastest way forward.

### Give Your Manager a Break

Your manager will be stressed out sometimes, she is not perfect. It's not to do whatever it takes to make you happy all the time.

Especially as you become more senior, your manager expects you to **bring solutions, not problems.**

### Choose Your Managers Wisely

Your manager can make a **HUGE** difference in your career. So as much as you can, consider not the job, the company, and the pay, but also the manager.
