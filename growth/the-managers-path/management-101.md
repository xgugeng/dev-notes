## What to Expect from a Manager

Managers who

1. care about you as a person
2. actively work to help you grow in your career
3. teach you important skills and give you valuable feedback
4. help you understand what is important to focus on, and enable you to have that focus

### One-on-One Meetings

One-on-one meetings (1-1s) with your direct manager are an essential feature of a good working relationship.

1-1s serve 2 purposes,

1. they create human connection between you and your manager. The bedrock of strong teams is human connection, which leads to trust.
2. A regular opportunity for you to speak privately with your manager about what ever needs discussing. *It's good for you to put a little thought into what you might actually want to discuss before your 1-1s.*

If your 1-1 is a dreadful obligation for delivering a boring status report, try using email or chat for that purpose instead for free up the time, and bringing some topics to your own to the 1-1.

### Feedback and Workplace Guidance

The only thing worse than a getting a behavioral feedback is not getting it at all, or getting only during your performance review.

Good managers know that delivering feedback quickly is more valuable than waiting for a convenient time to say something.

When it comes to your role at the company, your manager needs to be your number on ally. *Sitting down with your manager and asking her what areas you need to focus on to get promoted.* If you don't ask your manager about a promotion, don't expect her to just give you one magically.

Your manager should be the person who shows you the larger picture of how your work fits into the team's goals, and helps you feel a sense of purpose in the day-to-day work.
