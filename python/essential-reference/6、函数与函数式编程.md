# 6.1 Functions

Fuctions are defined with the `def` statement:

```python
def add(x, y):
    return x + y
```

You can attach default arguments to function parameters by assigning values in the function definition. 

```python
def split(line,delimiter=','):
    statements
```

Default parameter values are always set to the objects that were supplied as values when the function was defined. 

```python
a = 10
def foo(x=a):
    return x
a = 5 # Reassign 'a'.
foo() # returns 10 (default value not changed)
```

The use of mutable objects as default values may lead to unintended behavior:

```python
def foo(x, items=[]):
    items.append(x)
    return items
foo(1) # returns [1]
foo(2) # returns [1, 2]
foo(3) # returns [1, 2, 3]
```

A function can accept a variable number of parameters if an asterisk (`*`) is added to the
last parameter name:

```python
def fprintf(file, fmt, *args):
	file.write(fmt % args)

# Use fprintf. args gets (42,"hello world", 3.45)
fprintf(out,"%d %s %f", 42, "hello world", 3.45)
```

In this case, all the remaining arguments are placed into the `args` variable as a tuple. To pass a tuple args to a function as if they were parameters, the `*args` syntax can be used in a function call as follows:

```python
def printf(fmt, *args):
    # Call another function and pass along args
    fprintf(sys.stdout, fmt, *args)
```

Function arguments can also be supplied by explicitly **naming each parameter and specifying a value**. These are known as keyword arguments. With keyword argument, the order of parameters does NOT matter.

```python
def foo(w,x,y,z):
    statements
# Keyword argument invocation
foo(x=3, y=22, w='hello', z=[1,2])
```

**Positional arguments and keyword arguments can appear in the same function call**, provided that all the positional arguments appear first, values are provided for all nonoptional arguments, and no argument value is defined more than once.

```python
foo('hello', 3, z=[1,2], y=22)
foo(3, 22, w='hello', z=[1,2]) # TypeError. Multiple values for w
```

If the last argument of a function definition begins with **, all the additional keyword
arguments are placed in a dictionary and passed to the function.

```python
def make_table(data, **parms):
    # Get configuration parameters from parms (a dict)
    fgcolor = parms.pop("fgcolor","black")
    bgcolor = parms.pop("bgcolor","white")
    width = parms.pop("width",None)
...
    # No more options
    if parms:
        raise TypeError("Unsupported configuration options %s" % list(parms))

make_table(items, fgcolor="black", bgcolor="white", border=1, borderstyle="grooved", cellpadding=10, width=400)
```

You can combine extra keyword arguments with variable-length argument lists, as long as the ** parameter appears last:

```python
# Accept variable number of positional or keyword arguments
def spam(*args, **kwargs):
    # args is a tuple of positional args
    # kwargs is dictionary of keyword args
```


# 6.2 Parameter Passing and Return Values

if a mutable object (such as a list or dictionary) is passed to a function where it’s then modified, those changes will be reflected in the original object.

```python
a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
def square(items):
    for i,x in enumerate(items):
        items[i] = x * x # Modify items in-place

square(a) # Changes a to [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```

The return statement returns a value from a function. If no value is specified or you omit the return statement, the None object is returned.To return multiple values, place them in a tuple:

```python
def factor(a):
    d = 2
    while (d <= (a / 2)):
        if ((a / d) * d == a):
            return ((a / d), d)
        d = d + 1
    return (a, 1)

x, y = factor(1243)
(x, y) = factor(1243)
```

# 6.3 Scoping Rules

When resolving names, the interpreter searches:

1. local namespace
2. global namespace
3. built-in namespace
4. `NameError`

One peculiarity of namespaces is the manipulation of global variables within a function.

```python
a = 42
def foo():
    a = 13
foo()
# a is still 42
```

To alter this behavior, use the global statement.

```python
a = 42
b = 37
def foo():
    global a # 'a' is in global namespace
    a = 13
    b = 0
foo()
# a is now 13. b is still 37.
```

Although names in enclosing scopes are accessible, Python 2 only allows variables to be reassigned in the innermost scope (local
variables) and the global namespace (using global).Therefore, an inner function can’t reassign the value of a local variable defined in an outer function. 

```python
def countdown(start):
    n = start
    def display():
        print('T-minus %d' % n)
    def decrement():
        n -= 1 # Fails in Python 2
    while n > 0:
        display()
        decrement()
```

In Python 2, you can work around this by placing values you want to change in a list or dictionary. In Python 3, you can declare n as `nonlocal` as follows:

```python
def countdown(start):
    n = start
    def display():
        print('T-minus %d' % n)
    def decrement():
        nonlocal n # Bind to outer n (Python 3 only)
        n -= 1
    while n > 0:
        display()
        decrement()
```

If a local variable is used before it’s assigned a value, an `UnboundLocalError` exception is raised. 

```python
i = 0
def foo():
    i = i + 1 # Results in UnboundLocalError exception
    print(i)
```


# 6.4 Functions as Objects and Closures

Functions are first-class objects in Python.This means that they can be passed as arguments to other functions, placed in data structures, and returned by a function as a result.

When a function is handled as data, it implicitly carries information related to the surrounding environment where the function was defined.This affects how free variables in the function are bound. 

```python
# foo.py
x = 42
def callf(func):
    return func()
```

Now, observe the behavior of this example:

```python
import foo
x = 37
def helloworld():
    return "Hello World. x is %d" % x

foo.callf(helloworld) # Pass a function as an argument
# 'Hello World. x is 37'
```
  
When the statements that make up a function are packaged together with the environment in which they execute, the resulting object is known as a `closure`. The behavior of the previous example is explained by the fact that all functions have a `__globals__` attribute that points to the global namespace in which the function was defined.This always corresponds to the enclosing module in which a function was defined.

```python
helloworld.__globals__
# {'__builtins__': <module '__builtin__' (built-in)>, 'helloworld': <function helloworld at 0x7bb30>, 'x': 37, '__name__': '__main__', '__doc__': None 'foo': <module 'foo' from 'foo.py'>}
```


# 6.5 Decorators

A decorator is a function whose primary purpose is to wrap another function or class. The primary purpose of this wrapping is to transparently alter or enhance the behavior of the object being wrapped.

```python
@trace
def square(x):
    return x*x
```

The preceding code is shorthand for the following:

```python
def square(x):
    return x*x
square = trace(square)
```

```python
enable_tracing = True
if enable_tracing:
    debug_log = open("debug.log","w")

def trace(func):
    if enable_tracing:
        def callf(*args,**kwargs):
            debug_log.write("Calling %s: %s, %s\n" %
                        (func.__name__, args, kwargs))
            r = func(*args,**kwargs)
            debug_log.write("%s returned %s\n" % (func.__name, r))
            return r
        return callf
    else:
        return func
```

In this code, trace() creates a wrapper function that writes some debugging output and then calls the original function object.

When decorators are used, they must appear on their own line immediately prior to a function or class definition. More than one decorator can also be applied.

A decorator can also accept arguments.


# 6.6 Generators and `yield`

If a function uses the yield keyword, it defines an object known as a generator. A generator is a function that produces a sequence of values for use in iteration.

```python
def countdown(n):
    print("Counting down from %d" % n)
    while n > 0:
        yield n
        n -= 1
    return

c = countdown(10) # none of its code starts executing, instead, a generator object is returned. 

# The generator object, in turn, executes the function whenever next() is called.
c.next() # Counting down from 10
c.next() # 9
```

When next() is invoked, the generator function executes statements until it reaches a yield statement.The yield statement produces a result at which point execution of the function stops until next() is invoked again. Execution then resumes with the statement following yield.

You normally don’t call next() directly on a generator but use it with the for statement, sum(), or some other operation that consumes a sequence. 

```python
for n in countdown(10):
    statements
a = sum(countdown(10))
```

A generator function signals completion by returning or raising `StopIteration`, at which point iteration stops. It is never legal for a generator to return a value other than `None` upon completion.

A subtle problem with generators concerns the case where a generator function is only partially consumed.

```python
for n in countdown(10):
    if n == 2: break
    statements
```

To handle this case, generator objects have a method `close()` that is used to signal a shutdown.When a generator is no longer used or deleted, `close()` is called.

Inside the generator function, `close()` is signaled by a `GeneratorExit` exception occurring on the `yield` statement.You can optionally catch this exception to perform cleanup actions.

```python
def countdown(n):
    print("Counting down from %d" % n)
    try:
        while n > 0:
            yield n
            n = n - 1
    except GeneratorExit:
        print("Only made it to %d" % n)
```

Although it is possible to catch `GeneratorExit`, it is illegal for a generator function to handle the exception and produce another output value using `yield`.


# 6.7 Coroutines and `yield` Expressions

Inside a function, the `yield` statement can also be used as an expression that appears on the right side of an assignment operator. 

```python
def receiver():
    print("Ready to receive")
    while True:
        n = (yield)
        print("Got %s" % n)
```

A function that uses `yield` in this manner is known as a **coroutine**, and it executes in response to values being sent to it. Its behavior is also very similar to a generator.

```
>>> r = receiver()
>>> r.next() # Advance to first yield (r._ _next_ _() in Python 3)
Ready to receive
>>> r.send(1)
Got 1
>>> r.send(2)
Got 2
>>> r.send("Hello")
Got Hello
```

The requirement of first calling `next()` on a coroutine is easily overlooked and a common source of errors. Therefore, it is recommended that coroutines be wrapped with a decorator that automatically takes care of this step.

```python
def coroutine(func):
    def start(*args,**kwargs):
        g = func(*args,**kwargs)
        g.next()
        return g
    return start

@coroutine
def receiver():
    print("Ready to receive")
    while True:
        n = (yield)
        print("Got %s" % n)

# Example use
r = receiver()
r.send("Hello World") # Note : No initial .next() needed
```

A coroutine will typically run indefinitely unless it is explicitly shut down or it exits on its own.To close the stream of input values, use the `close()` method like this:

```
>>> r.close()
>>> r.send(4)
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
StopIteration
```

The `close()` operation raises `GeneratorExit` inside the coroutine.

```python
def receiver():
    print("Ready to receive")
    try:
        while True:
            n = (yield)
            print("Got %s" % n)
        except GeneratorExit:
            print("Receiver done")
```

Exceptions can be raised inside a coroutine using the `throw(exctype [, value [, tb]])` method where `exctype` is an exception type, `value` is the exception value, and `tb` is a traceback object.

```
>>> r.throw(RuntimeError,"You're hosed!")
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
File "<stdin>", line 4, in receiver
RuntimeError: You're hosed!
```

Exceptions raised in this manner will originate at the currently executing yield statement in the coroutine. A coroutine can elect to catch exceptions and handle them as appropriate. It is not safe to use `throw()` as an asynchronous signal to a coroutine—it should never be invoked from a separate execution thread or in a signal handler.

A coroutine may simultaneously receive and emit return values using `yield` if values are supplied in the `yield` expression. 

```python
def line_splitter(delimiter=None):
    print("Ready to split")
    result = None
    while True:
        line = (yield result)
        result = line.split(delimiter)
```

```
>>> s = line_splitter(",")
>>> s.next()
Ready to split
>>> s.send("A,B,C")
['A', 'B', 'C' ]
>>> s.send("100,200,300")
['100', '200', '300']
>>>
```

The first `next()` call advances the coroutine to `(yield result)`, which returns `None`, the initial value of result. On subsequent `send()` calls, the received value is placed in line and split into result. The value returned by `send()` is the value passed to the next `yield` statement encountered. In other words, the value returned by `send()` comes from the next yield expression, not the one responsible for receiving the value passed by `send()`.

# 6.8 Using Generators and Coroutines

Generator functions are useful if you want to set up a processing pipeline, similar in nature to using a pipe in the UNIX shell.

```python
import os
import fnmatch

@coroutine
def find_files(target):
    while True:
        topdir, pattern = (yield)
        for path, dirname, filelist in os.walk(topdir):
            for name in filelist:
                if fnmatch.fnmatch(name,pattern):
                    target.send(os.path.join(path,name))

import gzip, bz2
@coroutine
def opener(target):
    while True:
        name = (yield)
        if name.endswith(".gz"): f = gzip.open(name)
        elif name.endswith(".bz2"): f = bz2.BZ2File(name)
        else: f = open(name)
        target.send(f)

@coroutine
def cat(target):
    while True:
        f = (yield)
        for line in f:
        target.send(line)

@coroutine
def grep(pattern, target):
    while True:
        line = (yield)
        if pattern in line:
            target.send(line)

@coroutine
def printer():
    while True:
        line = (yield)
        sys.stdout.write(line)
```

Here is how you would link these coroutines to create a dataflow processing pipeline:

```python
finder = find_files(opener(cat(grep("python",printer()))))
# Now, send a value
finder.send(("www","access-log*"))
finder.send(("otherwww","access-log*"))
```


# 6.9 List Comprehensions

```python
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squares = [n * n for n in nums]
```

The general syntax for a list comprehension is as follows:

```python
[expression for item1 in iterable1 if condition1
            for item2 in iterable2 if condition2
            ...
            for itemN in iterableN if conditionN ]
```

This syntax is roughly equivalent to the following code:

```python
s = []
for item1 in iterable1:
    if condition1:
        for item2 in iterable2:
            if condition2:
                ...
                for itemN in iterableN:
                    if conditionN: s.append(expression)
```

In Python 2, the iteration variables defined within a list comprehension are evaluated within the current scope and remain defined after
the list comprehension has executed. Fortunately, this is not the case in Python 3 where the iteration variable remains private.


# 6.10 Generator Expressions

A generator expression is an object that carries out the same computation as a list comprehension, but which iteratively produces the result.

```python
(expression for item1 in iterable1 if condition1
            for item2 in iterable2 if condition2
            ...
            for itemN in iterableN if conditionN)
```

Unlike a list comprehension, a generator expression does not actually create a list or immediately evaluate the expression inside the parentheses. Instead, it creates a generator object that produces the values on demand via iteration.

```python
# Read a file
f = open("data.txt") # Open a file
lines = (t.strip() for t in f) # Read lines, strip trailing/leading whitespace

comments = (t for t in lines if t[0] == '#') # All comments
for c in comments:
    print(c)
```

A generator expression can be converted into a list using the built-in `list()` function:

```python
clist = list(comments)
```


# 6.11 Declarative Programming

List comprehensions and generator expressions are strongly tied to operations found in declarative languages.

Suppose you had a file “portfolio.txt” containing stock portfolio data like this:

```
AA 100 32.20
IBM 50 91.10
CAT 150 83.44
MSFT 200 51.23
GE 95 40.37
MSFT 50 65.10
IBM 100 70.44
```

```python
lines = open("portfolio.txt")
fields = (line.split() for line in lines)
print(sum(float(f[1]) * float(f[2]) for f in fields))
```


# 6.12 The `lambda` Operator

Anonymous functions in the form of an expression can be created using the lambda statement:

```python
lambda args : expression
```

`args` is a comma-separated list of arguments, and `expression` is an expression involving those arguments. 

```python
a = lambda x,y : x+y
r = a(2,3) # r gets 5
```

The code defined with lambda must be a valid expression. Multiple statements and other non-expression statements, such as `for` and `while`, cannot appear in a lambda statement. lambda expressions follow the same scoping rules as functions.


# 6.13 Recursion

The function `sys.getrecursionlimit()` returns the current maximum recursion depth, and the function `sys.setrecursionlimit()` can be used to change the value. The default value is 1000. A `RuntimeError` exception is raised when the recursion depth is exceeded. Python does not perform tail-recursion optimization.

```python
def flatten(lists):
    for s in lists:
        if isinstance(s,list):
            flatten(s)
        else:
            print(s)

items = [[1,2,3],[4,5,[5,6]],[7,8,9]]
flatten(items) # Prints 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
```

Care should also be taken when mixing recursive functions and decorators. If a decorator is applied to a recursive function, all inner recursive calls now get routed through the decorated version. 

```python
@locked
def factorial(n):
    if n <= 1: return 1
    else: return n * factorial(n - 1) # Calls the wrapped version of factorial
```


# 6.14 Documentation Strings

It is common practice for the first statement of function to be a documentation string describing its usage. 

```python
def factorial(n):
    """Computes n factorial. For example:
        >>> factorial(6)
        120
        >>>
    """
    if n <= 1: return 1
    else: return n*factorial(n-1)
```

The documentation string is stored in the `__doc__` attribute of the function that is commonly used by IDEs to provide interactive help.

If you are using decorators, be aware that wrapping a function with a decorator can break the help features associated with documentation strings. 

```python
def wrap(func):
    call(*args,**kwargs):
        return func(*args,**kwargs)
    return call

@wrap
def factorial(n):
    """Computes n factorial."""
```

If a user requests help on this version of `factorial()`, he will get a rather cryptic explanation:

```
>>> help(factorial)
Help on function call in module __main__:
call(*args, **kwargs)
(END)
>>>
```

To fix this, write decorator functions so that they propagate the function name and documentation string. 

```python
def wrap(func):
    call(*args,**kwargs):
        return func(*args,**kwargs)
    call.__doc__ = func.__doc__
    call.__name__ = func.__name__
    return call
```

Because this is a common problem, the functools module provides a function wraps that can automatically copy these attributes. Not surprisingly, it is also a decorator:

```python
from functools import wraps
def wrap(func):
    @wraps(func)
    call(*args,**kwargs):
        return func(*args,**kwargs)
    return call
```


# 6.15 Function Attributes

Functions can have arbitrary attributes attached to them. 

```python
def foo():
    statements
foo.secure = 1
foo.private = 1
```

Function attributes are stored in a dictionary that is available as the `__dict__` attribute of a function.

If a function is wrapped by a decorator, access to the attributes will actually take place on the decorator function, not the original implementation.

```python
def wrap(func):
    call(*args,**kwargs):
        return func(*args,**kwargs)
    call.__doc__ = func.__doc__
    call.__name__ = func.__name__
    call.__dict__.update(func.__dict__)
    return call
```


# 6.16 `eval()`, `exec()` And `compile()`

The `eval(str [,globals [,locals]])` function executes an expression string and returns the result. 

```python
a = eval('3*math.sin(3.5+x) + 7.2')
```

Similarly, the `exec(str [, globals [, locals]])` function executes a string containing arbitrary Python code.The code supplied to `    exec()` is executed as if the code actually appeared in place of the exec operation. 

```python
a = [3, 5, 10, 13]
exec("for i in a: print(i)")
```

One caution with `exec` is that in Python 2, `exec` is actually defined as a statement.

Both of these functions execute within the namespace of the caller (which is used to resolve any symbols that appear within a string or file). Optionally, `eval()` and `exec()` can accept one or two mapping objects that serve as the global and local namespaces for the code to be executed, respectively.

```python
globals = {'x': 7,
            'y': 10,
            'birds': ['Parrot', 'Swallow', 'Albatross']
            }
locals = { }
# Execute using the above dictionaries as the global and local namespace
a = eval("3 * x + 4 * y", globals, locals)
exec("for b in birds: print(b)", globals, locals)
```

The `compile(str,filename,kind)` function compiles a string into bytecode in which `str` is a string containing the code to be compiled and `filename` is the file in which the string is defined (for use in traceback generation). The kind argument specifies the type of code being compiled—'single' for a single statement, 'exec' for a set of statements, or 'eval' for an expression.The code object returned by the `compile()` function can also be passed to the `eval()` function and `exec()` statement.

```python
s = "for i in range(0,10): print(i)"
c = compile(s,'','exec') # Compile into a code object
exec(c) # Execute it
s2 = "3 * x + 4 * y"
c2 = compile(s2, '', 'eval') # Compile into an expression
result = eval(c2) # Execute i
```
